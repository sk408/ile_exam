## Texas-Specific Information for Hearing Instrument Fitters/Dispensers

### Texas Licensing Requirements (TDLR)
- **ILE Exam**: Must pass the International Licensing Examination (administered by IHS).
- **Texas Jurisprudence Exam**: Required online test covering Texas Occupations Code Chapter 402 and state/federal laws related to hearing instrument fitting and dispensing. Certificate of completion required for licensing.
- **Supervisor Requirements**: Apprentices must work under a licensed fitter/dispenser supervisor.
- **License Types**: Fitter, Dispenser, or Fitter/Dispenser (combined).

### Key Texas-Specific Regulations (Occupations Code Chapter 402)
- **Medical Clearance**: Texas requires written documentation that patient has been medically evaluated by a physician (within 6 months for adults; more stringent for children). Patients may waive medical evaluation if ≥18 years old and fully informed of importance (signed waiver required).
- **Pediatric Requirements**: Children under 18 require physician clearance; no waiver permitted. Additional care and documentation required.
- **Refund Policy**: 30-day trial period required; specific refund policy must be disclosed in writing before purchase.
- **Advertising Rules**: Must not use misleading advertising; cannot claim hearing aids restore normal hearing or prevent/cure disease.
- **Record Retention**: Must maintain patient records for minimum of 5 years from date of last visit (16 TAC § 112.140(d)).
- **Continuing Education**: Required for license renewal (check TDLR for current CE hour requirements).
- **OTC Hearing Aids (2022+)**: Must understand scope—OTC devices for perceived mild-moderate loss in adults ≥18; cannot fit OTC to children; different dispensing rules apply.
- **Sanction Awareness**: TDLR maintains published list of penalties/sanctions for violations (practicing without license, fraud, unprofessional conduct, etc.).

### Texas Scope of Practice Key Points
✓ Conduct hearing tests for hearing aid evaluation purposes
✓ Select and fit hearing instruments
✓ Make earmold impressions
✓ Provide hearing aid orientation and counseling
✗ Cannot diagnose medical conditions (refer to physician/audiologist)
✗ Cannot practice audiology (comprehensive diagnostic testing beyond hearing aid evaluation)
✗ Cannot remove impacted cerumen unless specifically trained and within scope

## Common Exam Trap Questions & Strategies

### What Are "Trap" Questions?
Trap questions are designed to test depth of understanding by using:
- **Subtle distractors** that sound correct but contain key errors
- **"EXCEPT" or "NOT" phrasing** that reverses the question
- **Close numerical values** that test precise knowledge
- **Partially correct answers** where only one option is fully correct
- **Scenario overload** with extraneous information to distract

### How to Avoid Traps
1. **Read TWICE**: Read the question stem carefully; note "EXCEPT," "NOT," "FIRST," "BEST," "MOST LIKELY"
2. **Identify what's being asked**: Clinical decision? Calculation? Safety issue? Scope of practice?
3. **Eliminate obviously wrong answers first**
4. **Watch for absolute words**: "always," "never," "only," "all" are often wrong
5. **Choose the safest/most conservative option** when in doubt
6. **Manage time**: ~68 seconds per question average; flag and return to difficult ones

### Example Trap Questions with Analysis

#### Trap #1: EXCEPT/NOT Questions
**Question**: All of the following are red flags requiring medical referral EXCEPT:
- A) Sudden unilateral hearing loss
- B) Persistent otalgia with otorrhea  
- C) Bilateral symmetric presbycusis with gradual onset
- D) Unilateral pulsatile tinnitus

**Trap**: Reading quickly, you might focus on red flags and pick A, B, or D without noticing "EXCEPT"
**Answer**: C (This is NOT a red flag; it's typical age-related hearing loss)

#### Trap #2: Close Numerical Values
**Question**: Using insert earphones, typical interaural attenuation is:
- A) 40 dB
- B) 45 dB
- C) 50 dB
- D) 55 dB

**Trap**: Multiple plausible values; 40 dB is for supra-aural (common distractor)
**Answer**: D (55 dB for inserts; 40 dB for supra-aural)

#### Trap #3: "Best FIRST Action" Questions
**Question**: SRT is 30 dB HL; PTA is 55 dB HL. What is the BEST FIRST action?
- A) Fit hearing aids bilaterally
- B) Refer for medical evaluation
- C) Reinstruct and retest for reliability
- D) Perform tympanometry

**Trap**: B sounds cautious; D seems thorough; but poor agreement suggests test reliability issue
**Answer**: C (Address test validity before other actions)

#### Trap #4: Partially Correct Answers
**Question**: For pediatric fitting, which is MOST critical?
- A) Using DSL v5 targets
- B) Measuring RECD
- C) Ensuring tamperproof battery doors
- D) Using soft silicone earmolds

**Trap**: All are important for pediatric fitting! Must choose the MOST critical
**Answer**: B (RECD is essential for accurate verification; others are important but RECD affects accuracy of the entire fitting)

#### Trap #5: Scope of Practice Boundaries
**Question**: A patient presents with moderate cerumen bilaterally. You should:
- A) Remove it immediately with curette
- B) Remove only if you are trained and it's within your state scope
- C) Irrigate forcefully
- D) Always refer to physician

**Trap**: A and C are unsafe; D seems overly cautious; B requires knowing your scope
**Answer**: B (Scope and training vary by state; must know your limits)

#### Trap #6: Masking Decision
**Question**: Right ear AC at 1 kHz = 80 dB HL (insert earphones). Left ear BC = 25 dB HL. Should you mask the left ear during right ear AC testing?
- A) No masking needed
- B) Yes, crossover is possible
- C) Only mask if ABG exists
- D) Mask only for bone conduction

**Analysis**: AC(right) − IA ≥ BC(left)? → 80 − 55 = 25; is 25 ≥ 25? YES (at threshold)
**Answer**: B (Crossover is possible; mask the non-test ear)

#### Trap #7: "Always" vs Reality
**Question**: REM verification is:
- A) Always required by law
- B) The gold standard but not legally required in all states
- C) Never necessary if using manufacturer first-fit
- D) Only for pediatric fittings

**Trap**: "Always" and "Never" are usually wrong; C undermines best practice
**Answer**: B (Best practice but state laws vary)

### Trap Question Practice Strategy
- **Do 10 trap questions daily** during your last 2 weeks of study
- **Analyze WHY each distractor is wrong**, not just why the answer is right
- **Time yourself**: Practice identifying trap wording quickly
- **Create your own**: Write trap questions based on content you find confusing

## Troubleshooting Flowcharts & Decision Trees

### Flowchart 1: Medical Referral Decision Tree

```
START: Patient presents for hearing aid services
    ↓
Does patient have any RED FLAGS?
• Sudden/rapid hearing loss (esp. unilateral)
• Unilateral/asymmetric loss or tinnitus (≥15 dB at 2+ frequencies)
• Pulsatile tinnitus
• Persistent otalgia or otorrhea
• Acute vertigo or significant imbalance
• Visible deformity/trauma/perforation
• Recent ear surgery (<6 months)
• Suspected cholesteatoma
• History suggesting retrocochlear (positive decay, rollover, etc.)
    ↓
YES → IMMEDIATE MEDICAL REFERRAL (stop HA services until cleared)
    ↓
NO → Continue evaluation
    ↓
Check medical clearance (Texas: required within 6 months; waiver allowed ≥18 yo)
    ↓
Medical clearance obtained or waiver signed?
    ↓
YES → Proceed with assessment and fitting
NO → Obtain clearance/waiver before dispensing
```

### Flowchart 2: Masking Decision for Air Conduction

```
START: Testing AC threshold in test ear
    ↓
Calculate: AC(test ear) − IA
• IA ≈ 55 dB for inserts
• IA ≈ 40 dB for supra-aural
    ↓
Compare result to BC(non-test ear) or best BC if unknown
    ↓
Is [AC(test) − IA] ≥ BC(non-test)?
    ↓
NO → No masking needed; record unmasked threshold
    ↓
YES → MASK the non-test ear
    ↓
Start masking: EM = AC(non-test) + 10 dB
    ↓
Increase masker in 5 dB steps until PLATEAU
• Plateau = 3 successive 5 dB increases with no threshold shift
    ↓
Check for OVERMASKING: [Mask(non-test) + IA] ≥ BC(test)?
    ↓
YES → Overmasking; reduce or use inserts for higher IA
NO → Valid masked threshold; record with masking notation
```

### Flowchart 3: Feedback Troubleshooting

```
START: Patient reports feedback/whistling
    ↓
STEP 1: Visual inspection
• Wax guard blocked? → Clean/replace
• Receiver blocked with cerumen? → Clean/replace receiver
• Visible ear wax buildup? → Remove if within scope or refer
    ↓
STEP 2: Physical fit assessment
• Earmold/dome seated properly? → Reinsert/educate patient
• Correct size dome/mold? → Try larger/different style
• Vent too large for gain needed? → Reduce vent or close
• Mold shrinkage/poor seal? → Remake earmold
    ↓
STEP 3: Digital processing
• Run feedback manager/cancellation routine
• Reduce high-frequency gain (especially 2-4 kHz)
• Check MPO isn't excessive
    ↓
STEP 4: Verification
• Is feedback during specific activities (phone, hugs)? → Counsel/minor adjustments
• Persistent feedback at rest? → Return to Step 1; consider mold remake
```

### Flowchart 4: No Sound / Weak Sound Troubleshooting

```
START: Hearing aid produces no sound or very weak sound
    ↓
STEP 1: Power check
• Battery installed correctly? → Reinstall/check polarity
• Battery charged (rechargeable)? → Charge fully
• Battery depleted? → Replace battery
• Test battery voltage if available
    ↓
STEP 2: Check for blockages
• Wax guard blocked? → Clean/replace
• Receiver/speaker port blocked? → Clean gently; replace if needed
• Microphone ports blocked? → Clean with brush; don't poke deeply
• Tubing blocked/cracked (BTE)? → Replace tubing
    ↓
STEP 3: Check device status
• Is HA turned on? → Turn on; check LED indicator
• Volume too low? → Increase volume
• Muted via app? → Unmute
• Wrong program selected? → Switch to default program
    ↓
STEP 4: Component testing
• Test in different program → If sound returns, software issue
• Swap receivers (if modular RIC) → If sound returns, receiver faulty
• Test with listening tube (if available) → Confirms device output
    ↓
Still no sound? → Device likely needs service/repair; provide loaner if available
```

### Flowchart 5: SRT/PTA Agreement Check

```
START: SRT and PTA results obtained
    ↓
Calculate difference: |SRT − PTA|
• PTA = average of 0.5, 1, 2 kHz
    ↓
Is difference ≤ 10 dB?
    ↓
YES → Good agreement; proceed
    ↓
NO → Poor agreement
    ↓
Possible causes:
1. Test reliability issue (reinstruct/retest)
2. Configuration: steep slope or unusual shape
3. Spondee familiarity issue
4. Nonorganic component
    ↓
FIRST action: Reinstruct and retest
    ↓
Still poor agreement?
    ↓
Consider:
• Using different spondee list
• Testing at different starting level
• Checking for Stenger (if unilateral)
• Using 3-frequency PTA with different frequencies if configuration is unusual
```

### Flowchart 6: Hearing Aid Style Selection

```
START: Patient needs hearing aid(s)
    ↓
Assess audiogram severity
    ↓
Severe-Profound loss (≥70 dB)? → Power BTE + custom mold
    ↓
NO → Continue
    ↓
Assess special configurations
• SSD (one normal, one unaidable)? → CROS
• Asymmetric (one aidable, one unaidable)? → BiCROS
    ↓
NO → Continue to standard selection
    ↓
Check patient priorities/constraints:
• Dexterity issues? → Larger device (BTE/RIC); rechargeable
• Cosmetics priority? → RIC or custom ITC/CIC/IIC
• Retention issues (sports, small canals)? → Custom mold or secure dome
• Severe occlusion complaints? → Open dome RIC; large vent
• Heavy cerumen/moisture? → RIC/BTE with replaceable receivers
• Phone/streaming priority? → Bluetooth-enabled; telecoil
• Budget constraints? → Basic BTE or RIC with essential features
    ↓
Default recommendation for most: RIC (versatile, serviceable, rechargeable options)
```

## Section 1: Conduct Patient/Client Assessment
### Professional scope, safety, and infection control
- Consent, privacy, clear instructions; scope awareness and timely medical referral.
- Hand hygiene; PPE as needed; disinfect noncritical items; reprocess semicritical items per protocol.

### Case history (adult/peds) – key prompts
- Onset/time course; unilateral/bilateral; fluctuation; noise/trauma; otalgia/otorrhea; tinnitus (uni/pulsatile); dizziness/imbalance; otologic surgery; ototoxic meds; systemic disease (diabetes, autoimmune); communication priorities; dexterity/vision; tech preferences.

### Otoscopy and cerumen
- Normal TM: pearly gray, landmarks, cone of light. Abnormal: erythema, bulge/retraction, fluid line, perforation, exostoses, fungus, foreign body.
- Cerumen: removal only when trained and within scope; contraindications include suspected perforation, recent surgery, tubes (unless allowed), bleeding risk; refer when uncertain.

### Pure-tone audiometry
- Environment/equipment: calibrated; daily biological check; deep insert placement for IA and hygiene advantages.
- Frequencies: 250–8000 Hz; interoctaves (750/1500/3k/6k) when 20 dB gaps or fitting relevance.
- Threshold method: 5 dB down/10 dB up; threshold = lowest level heard ≥50% ascending.
- Bone conduction: correct placement; avoid pinna contact; watch for vibrotactile at low freqs; mask appropriately.

### Masking essentials
- IA (typical): inserts ~55 dB; supra-aural ~40 dB; bone 0 dB.
- When to mask: AC(te) − IA ≥ BC(nte); BC when ABG > 10 dB; Speech when PL(te) − IA ≥ best BC(nte)/SRT(nte).
- Start: AC(nte)+10 (dB EM); BC adds OE (~20/15/10/0 at 250/500/1000/≥2000 Hz) +10; Speech SRT(nte)+10 (or PL−IA+10). Plateau method; avoid overmasking (mask(nte)+IA ≥ BC(te)).

### Speech audiometry
- SRT (spondees): familiarize list; expect PTA agreement ±5–10 dB.
- WRS: PB words; typically 30–40 dB SL re: SRT or at MCL. Consider rollover for retrocochlear suspicion.
- Loudness: MCL and UCL/LDL; dynamic range guides compression/MPO.

### Immittance (tympanometry and reflexes)
- Adults: peak pressure −100 to +50 daPa; static compliance 0.3–1.5 mL; ECV ~0.9–2.0 mL.
- Jerger: A (normal), As (stiff), Ad (flaccid), B (flat—ECV differentiates perf/tube vs effusion), C (negative pressure).
- Acoustic reflexes: ~70–100 dB HL typical; CHL often absent; elevated/absent with significant SNHL; reflex decay → retrocochlear suspicion.

## Section 2: Interpret and Apply Assessment Results
### Degree of loss (adults)
- Normal ≤25; Mild 26–40; Moderate 41–55; Mod-severe 56–70; Severe 71–90; Profound >90 dB HL (children: normal ≤15).

### Type, configuration, and patterns
- Conductive: ABG with normal BC, abnormal tymps/reflexes.
- Sensorineural: AC≈BC elevated; recruitment possible; reflexes may be elevated/absent.
- Mixed: Elevated AC and BC with ABG.
- Configurations: flat, sloping, precipitous, cookie-bite, reverse, noise notch (3–6 kHz), Carhart’s notch (~2 kHz), rising LF patterns (e.g., Meniere’s).

### Cross-check and reliability
- PTA vs SRT agreement; WRS aligns with degree/config; tymp/reflex match expected type; use reinstruction/retest as needed.

### Referral criteria (typical triggers)
- Sudden/rapid loss; unilateral/asymmetric loss or tinnitus; persistent otalgia/otorrhea; acute vertigo; visible deformity/trauma; suspected perforation/cholesteatoma; medically complex cerumen; retrocochlear signs (e.g., significant asymmetry, positive decay, rollover).

### Apply results to management
- Amplification candidacy; unilateral vs bilateral; CROS/BiCROS when indicated; medical clearance/notification per local regulation; expectations and counseling plan.

## Section 3: Select Hearing Devices
### Decision drivers
- Audiogram configuration/severity; MPO needs; anatomy (canal size, bends), cerumen propensity; dexterity/vision; cosmetic preference; connectivity; budget/coverage.

### Styles and coupling
- RIC/BTE: versatile power/features, serviceable, rechargeable.
- Custom ITE/ITC/CIC/IIC: cosmetics/retention; smaller mic spacing; occlusion/feedback and canal constraints.
- Coupling: domes (open/vented) vs custom molds; vent size trade-offs (occlusion vs LF gain/feedback risk); damping, tubing, earhooks.

### Features
- Compression (WDRC, kneepoints/ratios), directionality, noise reduction, feedback cancellation, frequency lowering, tinnitus features, telecoil/loop, Bluetooth/LE Audio, remote mics/streamers.

### Special fittings
- SSD → CROS; unaidable + better ear → BiCROS; severe–profound → power BTE + robust mold.
- Pediatrics → DSL v5 targets, RECD, soft silicone molds, tamperproof, DM/remote mic compatibility.

### Batteries/power
- Zinc-air color codes: 10 yellow; 312 brown; 13 orange; 675 blue. Li-ion rechargeables common.

## Section 4: Fit and Dispense Hearing Devices
### Pre-fit and prescription
- Confirm audiogram; otoscopy; needs assessment; choose prescription (adults NAL-NL2; peds DSL v5).

### Programming
- Enter thresholds and UCL/LDL; set targets; adaptation manager; enable features judiciously; set MPO below UCL with safety margin.

### Probe mic (real-ear) verification
- Terms: REUG (unaided), REAR/REAG (aided), REIG = REAR − REUG, RECD (coupler→ear conversion; critical for children).
- Process: Position probe within ~5 mm of TM; measure unaided; measure aided; match prescriptive targets for soft/medium/loud; verify MPO with loud input.

### Electroacoustic test box checks
- OSPL90, HFA OSPL90, Full-On Gain, frequency response, EIN, THD; compare to specs.

### Validation (real-world benefit)
- COSI, APHAB, HHIE/HHIA, SSQ, IOI-HA; review goal attainment.

### Orientation and delivery
- Insertion/removal; controls/app; batteries/charging; cleaning/drying; wax guards; expectations; communication strategies; care plan; warranty/returns.

### Ear impressions (safety)
- Pre- and post-otoscopy; correct otoblock; observe continuously; stop if pain/dizziness; contraindications: suspected perf/tubes, recent surgery/infection.

## Section 5: Provide Continuing Care
### Follow-up cadence
- 1–2 weeks; 4–6 weeks; periodic (6–12 months) or as needed; annual hearing recheck recommended.

### Troubleshooting
- Feedback: improve seal/vent/coupling; reduce HF gain; rerun feedback manager.
- Weak/no sound: wax/receiver blockage; battery/charge; mic inlets; receiver swap.
- Distortion: moisture/receiver failure; dry; replace.
- Boomy own voice: occlusion/vent; adjust vent size/length; more open fit.

### Maintenance and documentation
- Cleaning schedule; desiccation; tubing/receiver changes; firmware; loaners/RMA.
- SOAP notes; serials/settings archived; outcome measures; referral letters.

### Counseling and aural rehab
- Expectations; consistent wear; communication strategies (positioning, noise control, repair strategies); involve family; support resources.

### Noise counseling (basics)
- Exposure concepts (e.g., ~85 dBA 8h as general reference); hearing protection options; NRR limitations; safe listening practices.

## High-Yield Numbers and Formulas

---

## Section 1: Conduct Patient/Client Assessment

### Professional scope and safety
- Informed consent, confidentiality (HIPAA/privacy), documentation.
- Infection control: hand hygiene, PPE as needed, disinfection/sterilization protocols.
- Red flags for medical referral: sudden/rapid/asymmetric loss, unilateral/pulsatile tinnitus, otalgia/otorrhea, acute vertigo, visible deformity/trauma, suspected perforation/PE tube without authorization, suspected cholesteatoma, medically complicated cerumen.

### Case history (adult/pediatric)
- Medical: ear surgery, otitis media, ototoxic drugs, noise/trauma, diabetes/cardiovascular, autoimmune.
- Hearing: onset, laterality, fluctuation, tinnitus/hyperacusis, communication situations, phone/streaming needs.
- Functional goals: work/home, groups, media, safety/alerts; dexterity/vision; tech preferences.

### Otoscopy and cerumen
- Normal TM: pearly gray, visible landmarks, intact canal skin.
- Abnormal: erythema, bulging/retraction, effusion bubbles, perforation, exostoses, foreign body, fungal elements.
- Cerumen: removal only if within scope and safe; contraindications (e.g., suspected perforation/tubes, recent surgery/infection); when in doubt, refer.

### Pure-tone audiometry
- Equipment: calibrated audiometer; daily biologic checks; correct transducer placement; inserts preferred for IA/hygiene.
- Frequencies: 250–8000 Hz; interoctaves (750, 1500, 3000, 6000) when indicated (e.g., ≥20 dB gaps, fitting considerations).
- Threshold method: clear instructions; 5 dB down/10 dB up; threshold = lowest level heard ≥50% of ascending runs.
- Bone conduction: mastoid placement; avoid pinna contact; beware vibrotactile at low frequencies.

### Masking essentials
- Interaural attenuation (typical): supra-aural ≈ 40 dB; insert ≈ 55 dB; bone ≈ 0 dB.
- When to mask (rules of thumb):
  - Air conduction: AC(te) − IA ≥ BC(nte).
  - Bone conduction: air–bone gap in test ear > 10 dB.
  - Speech: PL(te) − IA ≥ best BC(nte) (or ≥ SRT(nte)).
- Initial masking levels (heuristics):
  - AC: AC(nte) + 10 dB.
  - BC: AC(nte) + occlusion effect (OE) + 10 dB; OE ≈ 20/15/10/0 dB at 250/500/1000/≥2000 Hz.
  - Speech: SRT(nte) + 10 dB (or PL(te) − IA + 10).
- Plateau method: raise masker in 5 dB steps until three 5 dB increases do not shift threshold.
- Overmasking risk: Mask(nte) + IA ≥ BC(te); favor inserts to raise IA.

### Speech audiometry
- SRT: spondees; agree with PTA ±5–10 dB.
- WRS: PB lists; typically 30–40 dB SL re: SRT or at MCL; note rollover for retrocochlear suspicion.
- MCL/UCL (LDL): informs compression and MPO.

### Immittance (tympanometry and reflexes)
- Adult norms: peak pressure ≈ −100 to +50 daPa; static compliance ≈ 0.3–1.5 mL; ECV ≈ 0.9–2.0 mL.
- Jerger types: A (normal); As (stiff—otosclerosis/scar); Ad (flaccid—ossicular discontinuity); B (flat—effusion/perforation; use ECV); C (negative pressure—ET dysfunction).
- Acoustic reflexes: ~70–100 dB HL; CHL often absent; elevated/absent in significant SNHL; reflex decay suggests retrocochlear.

---

## Section 2: Interpret and Apply Assessment Results

### Degree of hearing loss (adults)
- Normal ≤25 dB HL; Mild 26–40; Moderate 41–55; Mod-severe 56–70; Severe 71–90; Profound >90.

### Type and configuration
- Conductive: ABG with normal BC; abnormal tymps/reflexes common.
- Sensorineural: AC ≈ BC elevated; no ABG; recruitment common; reflexes may be elevated/absent.
- Mixed: elevated AC and BC with ABG present.
- Patterns: flat, sloping, precipitous, cookie-bite, reverse-slope, notches (noise 3–6 kHz, often 4 kHz), Carhart’s notch (~2 kHz) in otosclerosis.

### Cross-check principle and reliability
- PTA vs SRT agreement; WRS consistency with degree; tymps/reflexes consistent with type; consider Stenger for unilateral nonorganic.

### Referral criteria (typical)
- Sudden/rapidly progressive loss; unilateral/asymmetric loss or tinnitus; persistent otalgia/otorrhea; acute dizziness/vertigo; visible deformity/trauma; suspected perforation/cholesteatoma; suspected retrocochlear signs (e.g., significant asymmetry, positive decay, rollover).

### From data to plan
- Amplification candidacy; unilateral vs bilateral; CROS/BiCROS for single-sided; medical clearance per regulations; counseling and expectations.

## Section 3: Select Hearing Devices

### Style selection
- BTE/RIC: versatile power/features, serviceable, rechargeable; RIC common.
- Custom (ITE/ITC/CIC/IIC): cosmetics/retention; consider canal size, mic spacing, occlusion.

### Technology and features
- Compression (WDRC, kneepoints, ratios), directional mics, noise reduction, feedback cancellation, frequency lowering, tinnitus features, Bluetooth/LE Audio, telecoil/MT/T, remote programming.

### Coupling and acoustics
- Domes vs custom earmolds; materials (silicone/acrylic), canal length, venting (occlusion vs feedback trade-offs), damping/tubing.
- Venting: larger vents reduce occlusion and LF gain but raise feedback risk; pressure vents balance.

### Special fittings
- SSD: CROS; asymmetric unaidable: BiCROS; severe–profound: power BTE + robust coupling; pediatrics: DSL v5, soft silicone molds, RECD, DM/remote mic compatibility, tamperproof.

### Batteries and power
- Zinc‑air codes: 10 yellow, 312 brown, 13 orange, 675 blue; Li‑ion rechargeables common; ensure MPO headroom.

### Assistive tech
- Remote microphones, TV streamers, telecoil/loops, captioning/phone solutions, alerting devices.

## Section 4: Fit and Dispense Hearing Devices

### Pre-fit
- Confirm otoscopy/audiometry; needs assessment; choose prescription (NAL‑NL2 adults; DSL v5 often pediatrics).

### Programming
- Enter thresholds/UCL; set targets; adaptation; enable features judiciously; MPO below UCL with margin.

### Probe mic (real-ear) verification
- Terms: REUG, REAR/REAG, REIG, RECD.
- Process: probe within ~5 mm of TM; measure unaided then aided; match targets for soft/medium/loud inputs; verify MPO with 85–90 dB input.

### Electroacoustic test box
- ANSI measures: OSPL90, HFA OSPL90, FOG, response bandwidth, THD, EIN; compare to specs.

### Validation (real-world benefit)
- Questionnaires: COSI, APHAB, HHIE/HHIA, SSQ, IOI‑HA; goal review with patient priorities.

### Orientation and delivery
- Insertion/removal; controls/apps; battery/recharge; cleaning/drying; wax protection; expectations and acclimatization; communication strategies; warranties/returns; follow-up schedule.

### Ear impressions
- Pre‑ and post‑otoscopy; correct otoblock; safe injection; stop if pain/dizziness; contraindications: suspected perf/tubes, recent surgery/infection.

---

## Section 5: Provide Continuing Care

### Follow-up protocol
- 1–2 weeks, 4–6 weeks, then 6–12 months; annual hearing checks or sooner with changes.

### Fine-tuning and troubleshooting
- Workflow: fit/seal → cerumen → receivers/mics → firmware → gain/output/compression → NR/directionality → counseling → accessories.
- Feedback: improve seal/venting, reduce HF gain, rerun feedback manager.
- Weak/distorted sound: wax/receiver, moisture, replace components as needed.

### Maintenance and repair
- Cleaning, desiccation, tubing/receiver changes, earmold refit, manufacturer service; provide loaners when appropriate.

### Counseling and aural rehab
- Communication strategies, family involvement, expectations, wear time, support resources, workplace/school accommodations.

### Safety/compliance
- Infection control at each visit; SOAP documentation; device serials/logs; warranties/return windows; noise counseling basics.

### Reassess or refer
- Perceived deterioration, sudden change, persistent discomfort or drainage, new vestibular signs, unilateral symptoms.
