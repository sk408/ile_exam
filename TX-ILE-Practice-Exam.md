## ANSWER EXPLANATIONS

### Section 1: Patient/Client Assessment

**1. B - Normal tympanic membrane**
A pearly gray, translucent tympanic membrane with visible landmarks (handle of malleus, cone of light) indicates normal middle ear status.

**2. B - Refer to a physician immediately**
Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a medical emergency requiring prompt physician evaluation, potentially within 72 hours for optimal treatment outcomes with corticosteroids.

**3. C - 20 dB difference**
An air-bone gap >15 dB indicates conductive hearing loss. A 20 dB gap clearly demonstrates a conductive component requiring medical evaluation.

**4. C - Lowest level where patient responds at least 50% of the time**
The modified Hughson-Westlake procedure defines threshold as the lowest intensity level at which responses occur at least 50% of the time.

**5. B - Don new gloves for each patient**
Proper infection control requires fresh gloves for each patient encounter to prevent cross-contamination.

**6. B - ±6 dB**
SRT should correlate with PTA (average of 500, 1000, 2000 Hz) within approximately ±6 dB. Larger discrepancies suggest test validity concerns.

**7. C - Fluid in middle ear or tympanic membrane perforation**
Type B (flat) tympanogram with no peak indicates either middle ear effusion, perforation, or complete cerumen blockage.

**8. B - When air-bone gap exceeds 40 dB**
Masking is required when there's risk of cross-hearing, such as when the air-bone gap in the test ear exceeds 40 dB.

**9. B - Possible retrocochlear pathology requiring medical referral**
Disproportionately poor word recognition relative to pure tone thresholds suggests retrocochlear involvement (acoustic neuroma, neural pathology).

**10. C - 85-100 dB HL**
Normal acoustic reflex thresholds occur at 85-100 dB HL for most frequencies. Absent or elevated reflexes may indicate pathology.

**11. B - Asymmetrical hearing loss >15 dB at two consecutive frequencies**
Asymmetrical hearing loss is a red flag that may indicate acoustic neuroma or other pathology requiring imaging and medical evaluation.

**12. B - Two-syllable words with equal stress**
Spondees (e.g., "baseball," "hotdog," "railroad") are two-syllable words with equal stress on both syllables, used for SRT testing.

**13. C - Refer patients with significant cerumen impaction**
Texas law prohibits hearing instrument fitters and dispensers from treating ear defects. Significant cerumen impaction requires physician referral.

**14. B - ≤20 dB HL**
Normal hearing is defined as thresholds ≤20 dB HL across all frequencies (250-8000 Hz).

**15. C - Notched audiogram with dip at 3000-6000 Hz**
Noise-induced hearing loss typically presents with a characteristic "notch" at 3000-6000 Hz (classically at 4000 Hz).

**16. B - High-level disinfection between patients**
Otoscope specula are semi-critical items (contact mucous membranes) requiring high-level disinfection between patients.

**17. B - Eustachian tube dysfunction**
Type C tympanogram with negative pressure peak indicates Eustachian tube dysfunction, often associated with upper respiratory infections.

**18. B - Ear pain with purulent drainage**
Ear pain with drainage suggests active infection requiring immediate medical evaluation. This is a clear medical referral indication.

**19. B - 250-8000 Hz**
Standard pure tone audiometry tests frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz, covering the speech frequency range.

**20. C - Possible retrocochlear pathology**
Abnormal reflex decay (>50% reduction over 10 seconds) is a red flag for retrocochlear pathology and requires medical referral.

### Section 2: Interpret and Apply Assessment Results

**21. B - Moderate**
Hearing loss of 41-55 dB HL is classified as moderate. 48 dB falls within this range.

**22. B - Air and bone conduction similarly elevated**
Sensorineural hearing loss shows both air and bone conduction thresholds elevated with air-bone gap ≤15 dB.

**23. C - Mixed hearing loss**
Air conduction at 60 dB with bone conduction at 20 dB shows both sensorineural (BC elevated above 20 dB) and conductive (AC worse than BC) components.

**24. B - 80-89%**
Word recognition scores of 80-89% are classified as "good" discrimination.

**25. B - Hearing aid evaluation**
Bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss with normal tympanograms is typical age-related or noise-induced loss appropriate for hearing aids.

**26. B - Explain findings in clear, understandable language**
Effective patient counseling requires explaining audiometric findings in terminology patients can understand, avoiding excessive jargon.

**27. B - Patient's social security number**
While comprehensive documentation is essential, social security numbers are not required (and raise HIPAA concerns). All other options are standard documentation.

**28. C - Mid-frequency loss with better low and high**
"Cookie-bite" audiogram shows hearing loss primarily in mid-frequencies (1000-2000 Hz) with relatively better low and high frequency hearing.

**29. B - Unilateral conductive hearing loss**
Unilateral conductive loss is a red flag requiring medical evaluation to rule out treatable pathology before hearing aid fitting.

**30. B - Possible test validity concerns**
A 20 dB discrepancy between PTA and SRT (should be ±6 dB) suggests test validity issues, possible non-organic hearing loss, or testing errors.

**31. C - Severe**
Hearing loss of 71-90 dB HL is classified as severe. 75 dB falls in this range.

**32. B - 45-year-old with sudden hearing loss 2 days ago**
Sudden hearing loss is a medical emergency requiring immediate referral for potential treatment with corticosteroids.

**33. B - Provide realistic expectations about hearing aid benefit**
Effective counseling includes realistic expectations: hearing aids improve but don't restore normal hearing; background noise remains challenging.

**34. B - Refer for evaluation of possible retrocochlear pathology**
Excellent low-frequency thresholds with poor WRS suggests retrocochlear pathology (acoustic neuroma) requiring medical evaluation before fitting.

**35. C - 5 years**
Texas law requires that records be maintained for 5 years from the date of last patient visit.

### Section 3: Select Hearing Devices

**36. D - BTE (Behind-the-Ear)**
BTE hearing aids provide the most output capability, making them suitable for severe-to-profound hearing losses.

**37. B - IIC or CIC**
Patients with excellent dexterity, mild high-frequency loss, and cosmetic concerns are ideal candidates for nearly invisible IIC/CIC devices.

**38. B - Improving speech understanding in noisy environments**
Directional microphones emphasize sounds from the front (where speech typically originates) and reduce rear sounds, improving speech-to-noise ratio.

**39. B - Larger BTE devices with easy controls**
Patients with arthritis or dexterity limitations benefit from larger devices with bigger batteries and easier-to-manipulate controls.

**40. B - Mild to moderate sloping high-frequency loss**
Open-fit RIC devices minimize occlusion and are ideal for mild-moderate high-frequency loss, allowing natural low-frequency sound entry.

**41. B - Reduce occlusion and allow natural sound entry**
Venting reduces occlusion effect (perception of own voice as too loud) and allows natural low-frequency sound to enter the ear canal.

**42. C - Open-fit devices or bone conduction aids**
Chronic ear drainage contraindicates in-canal devices. Open-fit or bone conduction devices bypass the problematic ear canal.

**43. C - Premium technology**
Premium technology hearing aids typically feature advanced noise reduction, multiple compression channels (6+), and sophisticated signal processing.

**44. C - Severe high-frequency hearing loss**
Frequency lowering translates high-frequency sounds (often inaudible) to lower frequencies where the patient has better hearing.

**45. B - Provide different amounts of gain for different input levels**
Compression provides more gain for soft sounds, moderate gain for medium sounds, and less gain for loud sounds, improving comfort.

**46. C - IIC/CIC devices positioned deep in ear canal**
Excessive cerumen producers should avoid deep-canal devices prone to wax blockage; BTE or open-fit devices are preferable.

**47. B - Allows direct audio from phones/TVs to hearing aids**
Wireless connectivity streams audio directly from phones, computers, TVs to hearing aids, eliminating intermediary speakers.

**48. B - Insert otoblock to protect tympanic membrane**
Proper ear impression technique requires otoblock placement to protect the tympanic membrane from impression material.

**49. B - Patients with conductive loss who cannot use air conduction aids**
Bone conduction devices bypass the ear canal and middle ear, ideal for conductive losses, chronic drainage, or aural atresia.

**50. B - Severe to profound hearing loss requiring maximum gain**
Full-shell earmolds provide maximum acoustic coupling and seal, necessary for high-gain applications in severe/profound losses.

### Section 4: Fit and Dispense Hearing Devices

**51. B - Balanced speech intelligibility and comfort**
NAL-NL2 targets optimal speech intelligibility while maintaining comfort, generally providing balanced frequency response.

**52. A - Prescribed gain targets are achieved in patient's ear**
Real ear measurement objectively verifies that programmed hearing aid gain matches prescribed targets in the patient's actual ear canal.

**53. B - REAR - REUR**
REIG (Real Ear Insertion Gain) = REAR (aided response) - REUR (unaided response), representing actual gain provided by the hearing aid.

**54. B - ±5 dB**
Target gain matching within ±5 dB at most frequencies is generally considered acceptable during real ear measurement verification.

**55. B - Pull ear back and up, insert angling posteriorly then anteriorly**
Proper insertion technique straightens the ear canal by pulling the pinna back and up, then inserting the device with appropriate angulation.

**56. B - Poor seal or improper insertion**
Feedback after insertion typically indicates inadequate seal or improper insertion requiring adjustment or re-insertion.

**57. B - Have patient practice insertion/removal until comfortable**
Effective orientation requires hands-on practice with patient performing insertion/removal under supervision until proficient.

**58. B - 2-4 weeks with consistent wear**
Typical acclimation to new hearing aids requires 2-4 weeks of consistent wear as the brain adjusts to amplified sound.

**59. A - Cancel and receive refund per contract terms**
Texas law mandates a 30-day trial period during which patients may cancel the purchase and receive a refund according to contract terms.

**60. B - Reduce mid-high frequency gain**
"Tinny" or unnatural sound quality typically results from excessive mid-high frequency gain requiring reduction for more natural sound.

**61. C - At room temperature in a dry place**
Hearing aid batteries should be stored at room temperature in a dry environment; refrigeration is not recommended.

**62. B - Wiping exterior with soft cloth and removing cerumen**
Daily maintenance includes wiping the device clean with a soft cloth and removing visible cerumen from earmold/receiver openings.

**63. B - More high-frequency emphasis than NAL-NL2**
DSL v5 generally provides more high-frequency emphasis compared to NAL-NL2, prioritizing audibility of high-frequency speech sounds.

**64. B - At medial end of ear canal (approximately 1 cm depth)**
The probe microphone should be positioned at the medial end of the ear canal (approximately 1 cm from tympanic membrane) to measure actual SPL.

**65. B - Input accurate audiogram data into fitting software**
Programming begins with entering accurate audiometric data into manufacturer software to calculate appropriate gain targets.

**66. B - Check for cerumen blocking receiver/earmold**
Weak sound despite new battery most commonly results from cerumen blockage; checking and cleaning is the first troubleshooting step.

**67. A - Showering (unless waterproof)**
Hearing aids should be removed during water exposure (showering, swimming) unless specifically designed as waterproof.

**68. B - COSI (Client Oriented Scale of Improvement)**
COSI assesses patient-identified listening goals and improvements in specific situations personally important to the patient.

**69. B - Be placed in a dehumidifier overnight**
Overnight storage in a hearing aid dehumidifier/drying container helps prevent moisture damage and extends device lifespan.

**70. B - Document objective benefit with hearing aids**
Aided audiometry provides objective documentation of hearing improvement with amplification, demonstrating measurable benefit.
